# Pacman
 Document Object Module Manipulation/Edge Detection

This exercise creates a factory which outputs 'Pacmen' onto the document object module. Every time the create pacman button is clicked, another pacman is created on the page at a random position.

How to Run:

The start game button initializes an action where all the pacment on the page will move to the edge of the DOM and then their direction will reverse. Clicking the start game button will cuase the pacmen to move faster.
